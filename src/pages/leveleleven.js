      <h3>The Website</h3>

      <p>One of the first things that I noticed while working with LevelEleven was their need for an updated website design. Not only did the design need to be improved, but the site needed a complete content overhaul in order to be much more informative and inclusive of the companyâ€™s digital products. I led this process from start to finish, establishing a comprehensive site structure, working with content writers for copy, designing each page of the site, and handing off to an outsourced web development company.</p>
